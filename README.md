```svelte
// work in progress
// current status: not much here but glimpses
```

_[cosmicplayground.org](https://cosmicplayground.org)_
is a free, open source, experimental,
**work in progress** website.
(<sub>i.e. this document is more _"hopes and dreams"_
than _"polished implementation"_</sub>)
It's currently steering towards abstract ideas like:

- explorable systems
- creation and communication tools
- programmable interfaces
- generative creativity
- multiplayer interactivity
- collaborative information management
- automated productivity
- training tools, skill building, and games

and so forth,
in domains like

- math
- dataviz
- web communication (web messaging in chats/forums, voting)
- ear training, music theory, weird audio widgets

using technology including

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
- many web libraries like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
- static cloud like [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) and other forms of time travel

_cosmicplayground_ aims to explore in many directions,
but the general goal
is to help us learn, create, communicate, and grow.
