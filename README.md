    current status: there's nothing here to see yet - just setting up and prototyping

_cosmicplayground_ (CPG) is a **work in progress** website exploring interactive
learning with ear training, music theory, and other neat stuff.
It ambitiously experiments in many directions,
but the general goal is to help us learn and grow.

[The code](https://github.com/cosmicplayground/cpg) is open source,
[the website](https://cosmicplayground.org) is free to use,
it's easy and cheap to self-host,
and we hope to grow a community of contributors.
