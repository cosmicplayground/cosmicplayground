```

_cosmicplayground_ (CPG) is an experimental **work in progress** website
exploring interactive learning with over-engineered web tech.
It plays with explorable systems, generative creativity, and other neat stuff
in domains like math, dataviz, ear training, and music theory.
It explores in many directions, but the general goal
is to help us learn, create, and grow.

[The code](https://github.com/ryanatkn/cosmicplayground)
is open source and permissively licensed,
[the website](https://cosmicplayground.org) is free to use,
it's easy and cheap to self-host,
and we hope to grow a community of contributors.
