[cosmicplayground.org](https://www.cosmicplayground.org)
is a collection of loosely related projects
that try to be useful or interesting in some way.
Here's what I got so far:

- [Deep Breath](https://www.cosmicplayground.org/#deep-breath),
  an interactive map of Earth with a rough answer to the question
  "if all ice on Earth melts, how will sea levels change?"
  The project tries to be interesting and visually pleasing,
  but compared to similar tools it has little scientific usefulness.
- several unfinished and/or weird things
  (warning: may induce ear discomfort or pain, OKAY??)
- an in-progress ear training game on the `earworm` branch
  that I might continue making one day
