## ideas

- FreqSpeeds game with dynamic difficulty (should you ever drop down a level of difficulty? need multiple to advance? lose advancement progress on misses?)
- interactive animation creator and element styling, starting with 3d transforms
- expressively "paint" with sound
  - start with the hearing test interaction model - play with interval bands
  - make it easy to record and share (data and sound both)
